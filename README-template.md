### Overview
The QR Code Component challenge from Frontend Mentor tasks me with creating a simple yet responsive QR code component. The challenge is great for honing skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.

I enjoyed working on this challenge as it allowed me to practice using  figma from smaller project, trying as much as possible in having an exact match of a design is something I have always skipped.

### My process
As easy as the explanation for uploading a figma file may look to me now, it was a serious challenge that I even thought of skipping, then I remember I could ask questions on the Discord community, and joining the pieces of response I got from the Discord community and the internet I was able to understand the concept of figma and uploading of the figma file.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox for layout
- Media query

### What I learned
This project help me practice using media query
I only used media query for a container, I have not used it in a couple of other element, but with this project I was able to include a few more element in my media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 360px) and (min-width: 300px) {
  .container {
    width: 320px;
    height: 499px;
    padding: 16px;
  }
  .qr-code-container .qr-code {
    width: 288px;
    height: 288px;
  }
  .text-container {
    width: 288px;
    height: 288px;
    padding: 16px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development
I want to emphasize more on using semantic element.
